# dice-roll

A simple and interesting game you can play with a friend.

Both players will be in a race for the first to get a total score of 100 points.

Each player will have their turn to roll a dice as many times as they want.

With the option to hold the current score after each dice roll or roll the dice multiple times to add up each consecutive dice roll score.

Any dice roll that results in a 1 pip, would make the player loose a turn.

If a player decides to roll the dice multiple times withiut holding their current score and eventually rolls a 1 pip, all the accumulated score will be lost and the player will loose the turn.

The first player to reach a total score of 100 points wins the round.

Hope you enjoy playing this dice roll game with your friends!

Remember to invite and Share with a friend.

Cheers!
